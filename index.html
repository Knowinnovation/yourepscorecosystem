            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>With the implementation of the EPSCoR Collaborations for Optimizing Research Ecosystems Research Infrastructure Improvement (E-CORE RII) Program (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf23147" target="_blank">NSF 23-587</a>)  and EPSCoR Research Incubators for STEM Excellence Research Infrastructure Improvement (E-RISE RII) Program (<a href="https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/epscor-research-incubators-stem-excellence/nsf23-588/solicitation" target="_blank">NSF 23-588</a>) programs, EPSCoR jurisdictions have an opportunity to greatly expand their research ecosystems in order to further develop their jurisdictional research capacity and broaden the participation of all individuals within the research ecosystems. In order to increase jurisdiction’s competitive advantages, both for EPSCoR funding opportunities and across the Federal Agency funding landscape, EPSCoR jurisdictions need to quickly develop and implement new best practices. The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) seeks to identify a diverse group of researchers, research institutions, government agencies, industry partners, EPSCoR Jurisdictional Science and Technology committee members[RS1], and EPSCoR state offices to work together to determine what the best practices look like and begin to co-develop innovative solutions.</p>
            
            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>In 2021, EPSCoR convened a committee of research professionals and EPSCoR jurisdiction leaders to collect feedback on shaping the future of NSF EPSCoR, which resulted in the <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/epscor/future-nsf-epscor" target="_blank">Envisioning the Future of NSF EPSCoR Report</a>. In response to that report, along with other <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/epscor/epscor-impacts-outcomes" target="_blank">reports</a> and <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4346" target="_blank">critical legislation</a>, NSF EPSCoR launched the E-CORE RII and E-RISE RII programs. As jurisdictions have begun to respond to these new opportunities, feedback pertains to several themes. A summary of these themes is below:</p>
<ul>
<h4>Jurisdictional Science and Technology Committees:</h4>
<li>What is the current structure of the Jurisdictional Science and Technology Committees given the unique opportunities and challenges present in EPSCoR Jurisdictions?</li>
<li>How can the Jurisdictional Science and Technology Committees co-develop and continue to grow the entire jurisdictional research ecosystem in concert with the E-CORE project(s) present in the jurisdiction as required by the E-CORE program?</li>
<li>How can the Jurisdictional Science and Technology Committees most effectively create partnerships with stakeholders beyond academia (e.g., private industry, non-profit organizations, business roundtables, chambers of commerce, business and technology incubators, economic development coalitions)?</li>
<li>How can/should the Jurisdictional Science and Technology Committees identify and facilitate opportunities across the jurisdiction?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<p>
<h4>Evaluation of the jurisdictional research ecosystem:</h4>

<li>How will the E-CORE projects, in collaboration with the Jurisdictional Science and Technology Committees, create an evidence-based assessment of the strengths, opportunities, challenges, and successes of the jurisdiction?</li>
<li>How can jurisdictions ensure proper focus balancing both the science topic-based opportunities and the underlying fundamental aspects of research capacity that allow a healthy research ecosystem to thrive?</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<h4>Co-production of the Jurisdictional Science and Technology Plan:</h4>
<li>How will the E-CORE RII projects and Jurisdictional Science and Technology Committees use the information gained above to create a “living” Jurisdictional Science and Technology Plan that expresses the strengths, opportunities, and challenges of the jurisdictional research ecosystem as it develops in real-time?</li></ul></p>

<p>NSF does not expect that there is a single answer to questions within each of these three themes. <strong>Each jurisdiction can, and should, develop its own approach based on the intersectionality of the unique strengths, opportunities, and challenges present in its research ecosystem. </strong></p>

<p>NSF expects this series of workshops to highlight both differences and commonalities in strengths, opportunities, and challenges across jurisdictions.  By connecting all EPSCoR jurisdictions through these workshops it is envisioned that opportunities for jurisdictions to work together [RS1] on different aspects of the developing ecosystem to develop nationwide best practices will be revealed. </p>

<p>NSF EPSCoR is excited to entertain future workshops to further develop solutions for these challenges in additional NSF EPSCoR-supported workshops.</p>
 
<p>It is expected that additional challenges will need to be discussed and addressed as each jurisdiction grows its respective ecosystem. These workshops will provide ample opportunity for other challenges and/or opportunities to be brought forward into the discussion.
</p>
          
            <h3>The Event</h3>
            <p>Shifting to a research ecosystem approach is not trivial, and NSF EPSCoR understands that it will require a revision for each EPSCoR jurisdiction based on its own unique strengths, challenges, and opportunities.  E-CORE RII and E-RISE RII programs provide significant opportunities and NSF EPSCoR requires key components to be present regarding the scope and co-production within the ecosystem, through collaboration among E-CORE projects, Jurisdictional Science and Technology Committees and Jurisdictional Science and Technology Plans.  However, it is not within NSF EPSCoR’s purview to dictate <strong>how</strong> this should be achieved for each jurisdiction given the complex nature of the research ecosystem that is unique to each jurisdiction.</p>
 
<p>Therefore, this series of workshops is designed to allow jurisdictions to connect both individually, and cross sectors and geographies, to work together to identify challenges and opportunities unique to each jurisdiction and then elucidate intersectional best practices to build their respective ecosystems. </p>

<p>These workshops will allow wide conversation to engage with large swaths for stakeholders to ensure broadest participation in the research ecosystem and that every individual, network, and organization has an opportunity to contribute.</p>

<p><b>To accomplish this, the workshop series  is divided into three phases:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phase 1 (April 17 and April 18, 2024, 2-6pm ET) </strong>– This is a two-part highly interactive virtual workshop series designed to allow broad participation across jurisdictions and sectors. The format will include short plenary sessions and several small group discussion sessions to enable cross-jurisdictional and cross-sector examination of the new ecosystem challenges and opportunities. The output of this phase is the collection of opportunities and challenges of the E-CORE RII and E-RISE RII ecosystem as well as proposed outcomes and best practices. This phase is limited to the first 950 registrants.</li>
<li><strong>Phase 2 (May 22-23, 2024) </strong>- This is a two-day in-person workshop, to be held at NSF, where the output of the virtual workshop series will be further developed. The three themes above, as well as new themes presented by the EPSCoR community during the virtual events, will be further developed into a collection of best practices and overall feedback to be made available to all jurisdictions. This phase requires a separate, competitive application and is limited to 130 participants. The goal is for each jurisdiction is to be well represented at this in-person event. Acceptance is limited to individuals who live/work in EPSCoR jurisdictions to ensure that each jurisdiction is represented equitably and with the broadest range of individuals possible.</li>
<li><strong>Phase 3 (June 20, 2024, 2-6pm ET) </strong>- This phase will include a final virtual session which will be part of the <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/epscor/epscor-live" target="_blank">EPSCoR Live!</a>[RS1]  webinar series open to the general public. This virtual session will include a discussion on the results of the Phase 2 in-person workshop and dissemination of the developed resources available for each jurisdiction.</li></ul><br>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The overall purpose of this three-phase workshop series is to enable a forum for the community to collaborate and develop tools, best practices, and resources to enhance the research competitive advantage of the overall EPSCoR community. The series is not intended for the community to provide recommendations to NSF EPSCoR.</p>
